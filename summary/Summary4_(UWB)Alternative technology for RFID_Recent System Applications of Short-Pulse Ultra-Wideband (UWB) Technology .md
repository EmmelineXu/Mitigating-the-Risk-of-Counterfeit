**Paper Title:** Recent System Applications of Short-Pulse Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Technology  
**Author(s):** Robert J. Fontana  
**Abstract:** Developed in the early 1960s, time-domain electromagnetics, the study of electromagnetic-wave propagation from a time-domain perspective, has given birth to a fascinating new technology, which today is commonly referred to as ultra-wideband (UWB). It has now been slightly more than 25 years since the 1978 seminal paper of Bennett and Ross, which summarized UWB's early applications. It thus seems appropriate, given the tremendous increase in interest in the technology since the Federal Communications Commission modified its Part 15 rules to accommodate UWB transmissions, to take a look at more recent system applications of this unique technology. This paper provides a brief historical perspective of UWB, discusses recent techniques for the generation and reception of short-pulse electromagnetic waveforms, and examines a number of recently developed UWB systems in the communications, radar, and precision-positioning fields. Finally, a brief assessment of future trends for the technology is provided.  
##  I. Introducing UWB (Ultra-Wideband)
UWB (Ultra-Wideband) is a short-range, wireless communication protocol that operates through radio waves. It is based on time-domain electromagnetics (i.e., the study of electromagnetic-wave propagation from a time-domain perspective). It has the following main features: 
- From time domain rather than from frequency domain.

- There are two types of UWB.     
1. Short-pulse systems: typically characterized by very low duty cycles with resultant high peak-to-average power ratios, are quite unlike modern UWB variants of conventional modulations. (main discussion in this article).  
2. UWB variants of conventional modulations: typically characterized by constant envelopes, which result in nearly equal peak and average power densities.

## III. Benefit

### 3.0 General Benefit
- Biggest advantage for UWB is precision localization. 
- Featured applied in Low data-rate applications (automotive radar for collision and obstacle avoidance): LPD and no interference, multipath immunity, superb power management, etc. 
### 3.1 Radar perspective
From a radar perspective, the advantages include (also can apply to other objects other than Rader): 
- higher range measurement accuracy and range resolution due to the shorter spatial extent of the transmitter waveforms; 
- enhanced target recognition due to detection of additional information from a target's separate elements; 
- ability to detect very slowly moving or stationary targets.
### 3.2 Communications Applications
For communications applications, short-pulse UWB techniques offer 
- increased immunity to multipath cancellation due to the ability to discriminate between direct and time-orthogonal reflected waves
- low interference to legacy systems when properly designed to minimize the effects of spectral lines, and increased communications operational security. 
- Furthermore, low-pulse-rate UWB systems have the additional advantage of having extremely low duty cycles, which translate into low average prime power requirements, ideal for battery-operated equipment
### 3.3 Compared to RFID
For active RF tracking and positioning applications, short-pulse UWB techniques offer distinct advantages than extended-operation RF identification (RFID) tags as follows:
- precision time-of-flight measurement
- multipath immunity for leading edge detection [i.e., first time of arrival (TOA)]
- low prime power requirements

## IV. Drawbacks
- FCC peak and average power constraints will ultimately affect the viability of UWB for high-speed wireless networking
- Many works needed to be done for international regulatory
- Issues related to interference to legacy systems for safety of life and safety of flight

## V. Future Work
- Over  past years, UWB technology has taken many twists and turns along its course toward commercial utilization. By now, no major application is founded.
- blanket international approval for UWB commercial use is still far from certain and, for the near future, this will be a major limiting factor for its widespread adoption.
