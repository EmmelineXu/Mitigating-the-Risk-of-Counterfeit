## I. Abstract 

This paper mainly talks about the application of RFID in supply chain management (SCM). And it discusses the aim of applying, problems faced and benefits of applying, etc. (see subtitles)

II. Aim of Applying RFID 
----------

RFID can play a big role in SCM. RFID **establishes item-level tracking**, which improve the level of efficiencies never before seen. 
	SCM is very important for future companies. Most of them regard SCM and stock controls as their future access. Specifically, SCM is the subject of “managing and controlling of all materials and information in the logistics process from acquisition of raw materials to delivery to the end user.”　
	Many corporations hold a cautious attitude on RFID, as it is a new technology and costly. Therefore, showing pros and cons of RFID should be important. 

III. Methodology
---------------
This paper is based on literature review, and as RFID is a new technology, the sources are: RFID vendor web sites, standards organizations, whitepapers and press releases.

IV. Benefits
----------
### **4.1 Non-Line-of-Sight Technology&nbsp;&nbsp;**


#### 4.1.1 Automatic Non-Line-of-Sight Scanning  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When tags of RFID are read, they **do not require line of sight**. It means it can be scanned in any directions, unlike barcode.
	The scanning speed is fast. RFID scanners can communicate to tags in milliseconds and have the ability to scan multiple items simultaneously. By having this advantage, RFID can be well applied in labor intensive scenario, such as checking and scanning incoming inventory.
		
#### 4.1.2 Labor Reduction   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By automating supply chain, RFID will **bring labor reduction to the whole process**. In traditional process, labor cost takes a high percentage. For example, check-in time can be reduced, verification cost of shipping process can be decreased, the waiting time for trucks to go through the gate can be reduced.  

#### 4.1.3 Enhanced visibility  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**By providing visibility**, RFID can provide real time information of goods to make them set in the right place at the right time, which helps to avoid goods overstocked or out of stock.



### **4.2. The Need for Accuracy**

#### 4.2.1 Item Level Tracking  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It can help to identify due dates of goods, automatically detect inventory and facilitate counting, which helps to maintain brand image.  

#### 4.2.2 Traceable Warranties and Product Recalls   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Facilitate traceability of problematic products rather than mass recalls, which can cause high supply chain losses.   

#### 4.2.3 Reliability  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By having low error rate, RFID is reliable.   


### **4.3 Tag and Data Characteristics**  

#### 4.3.1 Quality Control and Regulation  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By applying RFID, company can monitor the manufacturing and transferring process. Therefore, customers can reduce the probability of receiving counterfeiting goods, and the probability of stealing goods will also decrease.   

#### 4.3.2 Ability to Withstand Harsh Environments   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;RFID can be preserved even in a harsh environment (low or high temperature or hydrochloric acid). Therefore, RFID can be used for the supervision of automobile production.  

#### 4.3.3 Information Properties   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tags of RFID can save a lot of data (from small to large), and they can be updated in real time.
			
	

## V. Drawbacks of RFID


### **5.1. Software and Equipment Upgrades**.   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Companies has concerns on the shortage of RFID technique. They may have difficulty in having sufficient cash due to excessive RFID costs
   
### **5.2 Cost of Technology**    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The current cost of tags is too high to justify tagging all items. 
The cost of the label is closely related to the quantity purchased. If they do not buy large amount of RFID, the cost per RFID may be too high.  
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Now, companies’ main mark range is on pallets and cases level, rather than item level.

### **5.3 Deployment Issues**

#### 5.3.1 Manufacturing Sector Concerns    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Retailers hope to promote RFID, but manufacturers do not fully follow the ideal situation, as the cost is too high, and it is difficult to see short-term benefits. Therefore, the current stage is to use RFID when transporting goods to reduce costs and meet mandatory requirements.     

#### 5.3.2 Supplier and Retailer Cooperation    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Data synchronization, integration, conversion and communication are huge obstacles to making technology serve the organization," as RFID tags using EPC standard contain only one serial number. Then these serial numbers are needed to be linked to a database to use this information, so all parties must cooperate with each other.    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Lack of standards.     

#### 5.3.3 Interference and Reading Considerations    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;RFID uses the radio spectrum to transmit its signals, so it is easy to be disturbed, which hinders its ability to transmit clear and reliable information to RFID readers. The reader can only read the label facing a specific direction, so it needs to package the goods accordingly. Determining the best location for RFID tags can be time consuming   

#### 5.3.4 Privacy Concerns   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Privacy advocates worry that if RFID tags are placed in ordinary items, once the products are purchased by consumers, they may continue to be tracked.
Information on how to "close" the label once the item is purchased could be important.   

#### 5.3.5 Other issues   
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Many companies are uncertain about the benefits of investing in RFID, and they have invested a lot of money in barcode, so it could be difficult to apply RFID.
