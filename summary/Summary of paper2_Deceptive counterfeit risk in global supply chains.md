**Paper title:** Deceptive counterfeit risk in global supply chains   
**Author(s):** Ghadge, A., Duck, A., Er, M., & Caldwell, N.  
**Abstract:** 
The study investigates deceptive counterfeits in the global supply chains. It explores perceived
sources of counterfeits, their impact and identifies risk mitigation strategies in Business-toBusiness procurement. An online survey was used to collect data from 140 procurement
professionals targeted at a national purchasing body and affiliated UK purchasing groups.
The study findings show that counterfeit breaches are increasing, especially in low-cost spare
parts, sourced from tier-two suppliers based in developing countries. Counterfeits lead to high
costs, delays, lost sales, product recalls and even legal action. Network transparency, cost of
quality and pre-supply evaluation approaches and supplier relationship management are the
most effective mitigation strategies to overcome deceptive counterfeit risk in global supply
chains. The study contributes to supply chain academics and practitionersâ€™ growing research
interest in counterfeit risk.

## I. Method  
### 1.1 Developing Questionnaire  
- A questionnaire was developed. The questions in questionnaire are designed in an iterative process, and based on extant literature from academic and industry sources.

### 1.2 Collecting Data   
- They primary data are collected by the online survey. And the link are sent to the professionals working in the international procurement and supply field. The online survey was sent to 1350 members via email and LinkedIn message, and several reminders were sent to encourage participation.

- Ultimately, 140 useable responses were collected for analysis in this study. Although the response rate is low, it is believed to be acceptable, the necessarily sensitive nature of the subject.

### 1.3 Analyzing data

- Regarding data analysis, the research uses categorize the answer collected, and then uses graphs to show the result. It also uses Chi-square tests to check whether there is a relationship between respondents' counterfeit experiences and their responses to various questions such as industry, job title, and operation area.


## II. Benefits

- By now, three most common ways to detect counterfeits are i) high-level specification, ii) contract performance review and continuous improvement, iii) supplier relationship management and supplier contract management/development. The way of RFID applied into the afore-motioned three ways, and the drawbacks of these three ways can open a market for RFID.



## III. Drawbacks

- Industrial strategies on counterfeits in global supply chains include avoidance, detection, mitigation and destruction. As the existing counterfeit strategies is already complete, how RFID can play a role in these processes should also be focused. If RFID cannot play a big role, it is not necessary enough to use it.


## IV. Future Work


- Now, there are many counterfeits in use more than estimates identify to-date. This research suggests that future research can look into capturing deceptive counterfeit risks in global supply chains. Therefore, we can use RFID to capture an accurate number of counterfeits, and at the same time, mitigate RFID problems.

- Many deceptive counterfeits appear to offer an acceptable level of quality. There is an evident need for robust data to better understand deceptive counterfeits. Therefore, maybe we should discover more harmfulness of using counterfeits. And we should have sufficient motivation to apply RFID in this research.
